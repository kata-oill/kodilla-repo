		<h1>Title: We own the sky</h1>
		<h2>Band: M83</h2>
		<br><br>
		<p>Each shade of blue<br>
		Is kept in our eyes<br>
		Keep blowing and lightning<br>
		Because we own the sky</p>
		<p>Secrets from the winds<br>
		Burnt stars crying</p>
		<p>Soft soft or cruel<br>
		Can't we change our minds?<br>
		We kill what we build<br>
		Because we own the sky</p>
		<p>Secrets from the winds<br>
		Burnt stars crying</p>
		<p>So many moons here<br>
		Lost wings floating</p>
		<p>It's coming, it's coming now!<br>
		It's coming, it's coming now!<br>
		What's coming? What's coming now?<br>
		What's coming? What's coming now?</p>
		<p>It's coming from the sky<br>
		It's coming like the wind</p>
