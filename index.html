	<h1>Title: We own the sky</h1>
	<h2>M83</h2>
	<br><br>
	<p>Each shade of blue<br>
	Is kept in our eyes<br>
	Keep blowing and lightning<br>
	Because we own the sky</p>
	<p>Secrets from the winds<br>
	Burnt stars crying</p>
	<p>Soft soft or cruel<br>
	Can't we change our minds?<br>
	We kill what we build<br>
	Because we own the sky</p>
	<p>Secrets from the winds<br>
	Burnt stars crying</p>
	<p>So many moons here<br>
	Lost wings floating</p>
	<p>It's coming, it's coming now!<br>
	It's coming, it's coming now!<br>
	What's coming? What's coming now?<br>
	What's coming? What's coming now?</p>
	<p>It's coming from the sky<br>
	It's coming like the wind</p>
